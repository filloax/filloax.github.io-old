# Filloax's Poketools

Some tools I did for fun, currently mainly contains tools to view some rom-hacks/mods' documentations in an easier way and/or track some content (for example, challenge runs captures).

### [*Blaze Black/Volt White 2 Redux* Professor Oak Challenge Tracker](/poketools/bbvw/oaktracker)

Lists all wild area encounters (no hiddden grottos yet) in a table format and has a checkbox for each pokemon that gets synced with all others of the same pokemon. 

A Prof. Oak challenge is a challenge where you must catch every available Pokemon in each route and area you pass through.
