# Blaze Black / Volt White 2 Redux 
## Prof. Oak Challenge Tracker

<h4 class="collapsible">Info</h4>
<div class="collapsible-content hidden" markdown=1>
A Professor Oak challenge is a challenge run where you must catch all available pokemon in each route, as you progress through the game, and eventually fill the Pokedex.

This is a (currently very simple) tracker with the encounter data as a table, and a checkbox for each Pokemon. The checkboxes are synced, meaning if you check a Pokemon all checkboxes for that Pokemon will be checked. This _should_ persist after closing the page, etc.
